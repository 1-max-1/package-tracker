Entry 1:
-------------------------------------------
Created a repository on github for my project. I cloned it to my computer and just added a starting file.
Also setup a project on trello. I looked at existing package trackers and saw what sort of information they use and hot it is displayed.

Entry 2:
-------------------------------------------
Looked at different front-end frameworks or libraries I could use. Probably going to use react as it also has
something called react-native which allows it to run on android and IOS.
